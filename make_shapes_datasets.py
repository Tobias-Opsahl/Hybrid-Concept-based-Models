"""
Functions for making various versions of the artificial `shapes` toy-dataset.
Here is the structure of the functions:
    `generate_shapes_dataset()`, and the functions that calls it, makes a full dataset.
    `create_and_save_image()` makes a single images, sometimes with many shapes in it.
    `make_single_shape()` makes a single shape, to be put into an image.

The specifications of the contents are determined by the image `attributes`, which contain information
on position, rotation, color, thickness and more. This is drawn by `draw_attributes()`.

The attributes can be made correlatied with the classes, as the intention of this dataset.
Each image gets assigned `concepts` from `draw_concept_labels()`, where a concept might be
`big_figure` or `thick_outline` (True or False). The attribute is still drawn randomly in some interval,
but the interval is different depending on the concept.

The probabilities of a image getting assigned a concept is draw by `draw_concept_probabilities()`. If
`equal_probabilities` is `True`, this will make all proabilities 0.5, resulting in no corelation between
class and concept. If it is `False` however, the function contains a scheme of drawing correlated probabilites
for each class for different amount of total classes.

The datasets gets saved and organised in folders, with one folder of images for each class. The concept-labels,
class labels and image-paths can be found in `data-list`, which is stored as a pickle file. This can be split
into "train", "validation" and "test". There are also help function for renaming and making subsets of data.

    Draws the probabilites of drawing concept-lables. Draws one probability dict for one image.
    This function returns the probability that a shape will have a concept, which is drawn in `draw_concept_labels()`.

    This is made in order to have a strong corelation between some of the classes and some of the concepts,
    as determined in this function. The corelation scheme is unique for different number of classes.
    If `equal_probabilities` is `True`, all of the probabilites will be 0.5 (no correlation).

    The concept-labels contains `True` or `False` for concepts such as `big_figure` and `thick_outline`,
    which is then used to draw the exact values from `draw_attributes()`, which draws randomly,
    but the concepts determines the interval they are drawn in.

            for a triangle and ellipse in one figure, or ["rectangle"] for only one rectangle.
        concept_labels (dict): The concepts, returned by `draw_concept_labels()`. This determines
            things like the intervals the height, width or radius are drawn from (concept_labels["big_figure"]),
            and the interval the linewidth is drawn from (concept_labels["thick_outline"]).
            This is used int `draw_attributes()`
        height (int, optional): Height of the plot in inches. Total vertical pixels are
            `height * dpi`. Defaults to 64.
        width (int, optional): Width of the plot in inches. Total horizontal pixels are
            `width * dpi`. Defaults to 64.
        dpi (int, optional): `Dots Per Inch`. Determines how many pixels to assign to an inch in the
            plot when it is saved. Defaults to 100.
        base_dir (str, optional): Directory where the directories of images will be saved. Figures are saved as
            `base_dir` + `class_subdir` + `fig_name`. Defaults to "data/shapes/".
        class_subdir (str, optional): Directory of a given combination of shapes.
        fig_name (str, optional): The name of the figure. Defaults to "fig.png".
        use_position_concepts (bool, optional): If True, the position is drawn according to
            `concept_labels["right_side"]` and `concept_labels["upper_side"]`. This means that
            the concept_labels determines the quadrant the shape is made in. If False, the shape
            will be drawn randomly in the whole grid. It is recommended to set `True` when there
            is just one shape in an image (since then there are two more concepts to use), but
            `False` when there are two or more shapes (since they will heavily overlap otherwise.

        concept_labels: The concept labels drawn for the image.
